# key-codes-of-research
 Taking the Poyang Lake Eco-economic Zone (PLEEZ) as the illustration area, this project provides key technical codes of the Methodology in section 2.3 of the research "A novel multiperspective flood risk analysis framework and management strategy based on historical inundations and future scenarios" to provide a reproducible reference for potential users who are interested in our work.
## Part A: Historical inundations extraction 
 Based on the Sentinel-1 SAR data provided by Google Earth Engine (GEE), this code (named as "Flood_extraction.txt") is to extract the water bodies by two time-adjacent image changes.  
 Then, the flood evolution process can be inferred by repeating the code with a selection of images from different time periods.  
 
 <span style="font-size: 6px;"><i> The original version of the code was provided by the Office for Outer Space Affairs UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal (https://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices/recommended-practice-google-earth-engine-flood-mapping/step-by-step). The web site provides a step-by-step procedure tutorial for the generation of flood extent map using GEE. The original online code provided by UN-SPIDER can be accessed and run through this link: https://code.earthengine.google.com/fcb6e6089508ef94398d1079948ab28a. </i></span>
