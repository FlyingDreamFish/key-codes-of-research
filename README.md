# key-codes-of-research
 Taking the Poyang Lake Eco-economic Zone (PLEEZ) as the illustration area, this project provides key technical codes of the Methodology in section 2.3 of the research "A novel multiperspective flood risk analysis framework and management strategy based on historical inundations and future scenarios" to provide a reproducible reference for potential users who are interested in our work.
##  Part A: Historical inundations extraction 
 Based on the Sentinel-1 SAR data provided by Google Earth Engine (GEE), this code (named as <strong>"Flood_extraction.txt"</strong>) is to extract the water bodies by two time-adjacent image changes.  
 Then, the flood evolution process can be inferred by repeating the code with a selection of images from different time periods.  
 
 <span style="font-size: 6px;"><i> The original version of the code was provided by the Office for Outer Space Affairs UN-SPIDER Knowledge Portal (https://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices/recommended-practice-google-earth-engine-flood-mapping/step-by-step). The web site provides a step-by-step procedure tutorial for the generation of flood extent map using GEE. The original online code provided by UN-SPIDER can be accessed and run through this link: https://code.earthengine.google.com/fcb6e6089508ef94398d1079948ab28a. </i></span>


##  Part B: Historical precipitation extraction  
 The first code (named as <strong>"Daily_Precipitation_extraction.txt"</strong>) achieves the extraction and download of daily historical rainfall raster (.tif) for the target study area based on satellite-rainfall product CHIRPS on GEE.  
 The second code (named as <strong>"Calculation of RMAX3.py"</strong>) calculate the maximum 3-day rainfall (RMAX3) of the PLEEZ in 2020 based on the daily rainfall raster files generated by the first code (named as <strong>"CHIRPS_2020_1KM.zip"</strong> we provided).  
 Repeat these two codes yields other yearsâ€™ RMAX3.

 
##  Part C: Future precipitation extraction 
 The code (named as <strong>"Calculation of RMAX3.py"</strong>) extracts the RMAX3 for a given year using the future precipitation data "NEX-GDDP".   
 We provide the sample results (.tif) of RMAX3 of 21 models generated by this code (named as <strong>"Results of code run.zip"</strong>), as well as their average for 2020.  
 Since a single file (.nc) of this product is large in storage, original sample data is not provided here. Please see the website for the download of the original data: https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/land-based-products/nex-gddp.


 ### Note
 The techniques in other sections of this study can be implemented by means of spatial analysis, data statistics, etc. If you have any questions, please contact us by the email (kezhenyao@mail.bnu.edu.cn).
